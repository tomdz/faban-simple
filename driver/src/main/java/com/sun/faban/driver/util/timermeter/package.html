The TimerMeter is the work of, and contributed by Michael Kuperberg<br>

The TimerMeter checks and reports the cost and granularity of the timer, the
essential core of Faban's latency measurements. The results are used for
deducting the timer cost from the latency. This essentially eliminates a small
but systematic error from the resulting measurements. The impact on
coarse-grained measurements, (at the second or millisecond level) are
negligible. There is however some impact on very fine-grained measurements
at the low microsecond level accuracy.
